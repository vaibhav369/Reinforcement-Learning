# reinforcement-learning

## Description

This repository includes different reinforcement-learning projects pursued by myself while trying to learn the interesting field. The idea of training an agent solely by giving delayed outcomes is very fascinating. It lends itself very naturally to the real-world scenarios we come across. For example, stock trading given current prices, price lists and news information, can be treated as a very large reinforcement learning problem where the reward achieved is the profit/loss incurred.
